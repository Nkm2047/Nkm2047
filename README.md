### Hi, I'm Nicolás 👋

**Economist | Applied Mathematician | Data-to-Narrative Translator**

I live at the intersection of econometrics, computational understanding through mathematics, and tangible social impact. What drives me isn't just making models work, but understanding *why* they work, and using 그hat understanding to transform complex, messy data into clear narratives that drive public policy and social mobility.

### 🔭 What I'm working on

We live in an era where sophisticated algorithms manage increasingly critical decisions, yet a fascinating gap exists: we often master the "how" of implementation without grasping the "why" of their effectiveness. This question led me to pursue my **M.Sc. in Applied Mathematics** at the *Universidad Nacional de Colombia*, where I explore computational theory and numerical analysis.

Currently, my work moves across three spheres:

**In Academia:** I am researching the quantum approach to Topological Data Analysis (TDA) algorithms, exploring how computational limitations can be overcome through quantum frameworks. My starting point is the work of Lloyd, Garnerone, and Zanardi on quantum algorithms for topological and geometric data analysis.

**In Philanthropy & Data:** I apply predictive analytics to optimize fundraising strategies in higher education, using financial models and pattern detection techniques to connect institutional needs with social purpose.

**In my Tech Stack:**

* **For Econometrics:** I rely on `Stata` and `R` for causal inference and impact measurement, especially when working with quasi-experimental designs.
* **For Data Science:** I combine `Python` (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn) with `R` (Tidyverse, ggplot2), depending on whether I need production speed or exploratory flexibility.
* **For Data Management:** `SQL` for designing ETL processes and efficient queries that handle millions of records.
* **For Visualization:** `Power BI` for interactive dashboards tailored to non-technical stakeholders, and `ArcGIS` when the spatial dimension matters.

### 🧠 My Philosophy

This repository is my attempt to turn GitHub into an open space where I share projects, technical notes, and papers on computational mathematics, data science, and their theoretical foundations. Beyond numbers and lines of code, data is the footprint of human experience—understanding its patterns is understanding our society better.

If you are interested in these topics, or simply want to explore the mathematics behind data analysis and science, this space is for you.

I am always open to conversations about applied mathematics, evidence-based policy, or any project where data and social purpose meet.

*"The question isn't just whether an algorithm works, but why it works, and how that knowledge can transform lives."*
